- **What you'll learn:** Input validation, switch-case statements, and functions.

--- DONE

### **3. To-Do List**
- **What to do:** Create a program to manage a simple to-do list. Users can add tasks, view tasks, and mark tasks as completed.
- **What you'll learn:** Arrays or vectors, dynamic memory, file I/O (optional for saving tasks).

--- DONE

### **4. Temperature Converter**
- **What to do:** Write a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- **What you'll learn:** Functions, input/output handling, and formula implementation.

--- DONE

### **5. Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
- **What to do:** Develop a two-player tic-tac-toe game played in the console. 
- **What you'll learn:** 2D arrays, game logic, and loops.

--- DONE

### **6. Unit Converter**
- **What to do:** Build a unit converter for length (meters to kilometers), weight (grams to kilograms), etc.
- **What you'll learn:** Functions, switch-case statements, and handling user input.

--- DONE

### **7. Basic Bank Management System**
- **What to do:** Create a system where users can deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. Use a simple menu system for navigation.
- **What you'll learn:** Classes, encapsulation, and basic object-oriented programming.

--- DONE

### **8. Prime Number Checker**
- **What to do:** Write a program that checks if a number is prime. Extend it to print all prime numbers up to a certain number.
- **What you'll learn:** Loops, conditionals, and efficient algorithms.

--- DONE

### **9. Text-Based RPG Game**
- **What to do:** Create a simple role-playing game where a player fights monsters, earns points, and levels up.
- **What you'll learn:** Classes, loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

--- 

### **10. Student Grading System**
- **What to do:** Create a program to input students' names and grades, calculate their average, and determine their letter grades.
- **What you'll learn:** Structures, arrays, and input validation.

--- DONE

### **11. BMI Calculator**
- **What to do:** Write a program that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) given a user's height and weight.
- **What you'll learn:** Basic input/output, conditionals, and mathematical calculations.

--- DONE

### **12. File Reader/Writer**
