ideas for terminal RPG:

>> a chance to get the item while fleeing (reduced in comparision of victory)

=============== LOADING GAME ===============

You find yourself inside a comfortable cart full of wheat.
Suddenly, you hear a voice coming from the front of the cart.

> Hey you, you're finally awake.
> I see a dust fog that's coming toward us. I don't pay you to sleep all day, go take a look!

While half asleep, you take your wooden sword and your necklace of sausages andjump off the cart, trying to identify 
the source of the dust.

As your feet touch the ground, you feel so dizzy that you cannot even remember your own name.
It's on the tip of your tongue. It's ... {name}
How could you forget your OWN name !

Anyway, you finally identify the enemy.
(Battle)
    This is {monster} !! /// You're facing {m1} and {m2} !!
    What do want to do: attack or flee
    {answer}
    {m1} is at {monster_hp}. /// You manage to escape without any injuries. /// You failed to escape. /// You're confused on what to choose. {monster} doesn't wait for you.
    You're now at {hp}.
    You died... /// You managed to kill {monster} successfuly

You notice something shiny from the corpse.
It's {item} !
{item} gives {item stats} !

As you just defeated your first oponent, two others are approaching swiftly.
(Battle)

As strangely as the first time, you get two other items.
They are {item1} and {item2} !
{item1} gives {item1 stats} !
{item2} gives {item2 stats} !

> Wow, you defeated them so easily !
> And my shipment is unscated ! This deserves a bonus !
> Here, drink this potion and rest in my cart.

You drink this disguting mixture because why not.
After all, you are on the brink of death.
You feel the smarmy warm liquid going down your throat as if you were drinking someone's diarrhea.

As soon as you lay, you fell into a deep sleep.
The dream you are in feels familiar, you know this place.
Wait, this YOUR home! But something feels different.

By exploring an oddly familiar yet unknown world, you start to understand.
You are in Tel'aran'rhiod, the legendary world of dream strangely linked to reality.
Every wound you take here is real.

While walking on one path, you are attacked by {monster}.
(Battle)

You find {item} on the corpse.
{item} gives {item stats} !

>> (Boss easy)
    You're kind of afraid to continue, your walk but do it anyway because you don't know how to get out of Tel'aran'rhiod.
    As you continue you walk, you encounter Gen'duel the frightening, the legendary road thief!!
    > Alright {name}, let's fight !
    This is going to be a tough battle.

    What do want to do: attack or flee
    {answer}
    Gen'duel the frightening is at {monster_hp}. /// You manage to escape without any injuries. /// You failed to escape. /// You're confused on what to choose. Gen'duel the frightening doesn't wait for you.
    You're now at {hp}.
    You died... /// You've defeted Gen'duel the frightening successfuly.

    You are exhausted from this fight and go straight to your bed...

>> ELSE

You wake up with a headache, but without a trace of any wound, chained inside a gloomy cell.
You hear a voice... It's the merchant's.

> Ah, you'll be a formidable entertainment !

You realize that this jerk sold you as a gladiator in an illegal arena.
Now you have to fight for your liberty as for your life.

The rules of the arena are simple: you can only get out if the crowd wants it, 
and if you defeat an ennemy, you get its equipment.

Before entering the scene, you get back your equipment, yes even the one you got while dreaming.
Brace yourself, your fights will be harder as you kill more opponents.

For the first match, it's only one monster.
(Battle)

Following the rules, you take {item} !
{item} gives {item stats} !

Now, two at once !
(Battle)

From the lacerated corpses of the monster you oblirated, you choose {item1} and {item2}!
{item1} gives {item1 stats} !
{item2} gives {item2 stats} !

>> (Boss normal)
    The voice of the announcer resound through the overly loud speakers.
    > Now, lady and gentleman, it is time for the greatest fight of all time !
    > The rookie: {name} against the legendary: Alcathor the great !
    
    The theme song of Alcathor [Baby Shark] is blowing out of the speakers and the crowd is going crazy.
    The song won't stop, you have to beat him under these conditions.
    (battle)

    You're crown as the best fighter. 
    Unfortunatly, you'll have to fight until you die (even of old age) 
    because the public is thrilled at every single one of your fights.

>> ELSE

After, you've defeated mediocrily all your opponents, the public is bored and free you.
You come out of a manhole in the middle of a small town.
You so dirty that everyone that sees you is taking you for a beggar.

One soul takes pitty of you and give you an {item}!
{item} gives {item stats} !

You remember who put you through all this trouble: it's the merchand !
After all, he didn't even pay you for your services on the road !!
There you choose to go talk to every trader to see if they know him.

You get several kind of answers: 
> No, never seen. ; > Yes, yes, yes, eeeeh, finally no. ; > Get out of my face disgusting beggar !!

No info at all. There is still your last chance: Clement the bartender.
You enter the western-like bar and go straight to the counter while dodging every disgusted look of the other clients.

> Hey you, I've never seen you before. What makes you come here ?

It's Clement. You briefly explain your situation and ask for some info about the mysterious trader.

> Hmmm... I may or may not know him, if you know what I mean.

Of course, you have to pay him to get them. You hand him your gains from the arena.

> I haven't seen him personnaly but I know someone who, for sure, have a way to get to him.
> Follow me in the back.

The back is moody. You follow Clement into his cellar where he meets with his network of spies.
Here you meet Kagax, a singular person who seems a little be deranged (this is an understatement).

> Well, you want to know more about Mr.White ??
> Here's what I can tell you, he lives inside a manor in the south of the town.
> I don't why he likes to disguise as a trader when he clearly as enough money to buy the whole land.
> If you want to attack him, may the Vis Arcana be with you !

You note all those information in a part of your brain, get out of the bar and go to this manor.

The estate is far too guarded to try entering under daylight.
You also notice a sewer entrance from an nearby alley.
What do you want to do... wait or try the sewers ?

>> IF WAIT 
    Luck is with you because this night is a New Moon.
    You look around the house to see if there's any easier way to enter than knocking.
    The backdoor seems perfect for this job.
    What do you want to do ? knock or pick

    >> IF knock
        The door is unlocked...
        The place is marvelous, everything seems to cost more that any other house of the city.
    
    >> IF PICK 
        You try to pick the door...
        Nothing happened, the lock seems too hard.
        Let's try once again...
        
        The door opens, not because you succeeded, but because {a Guard} opened it.
        You have no choice but to fight.
        (battle)

        You collect {item} from the corpse.
        {item} gives {item stats} !

        The room you're in is a kind of food safe.
        Why not eat some while you're at it ?!
        (heal)

    >> ELSE
        You wait a little...
        GOTO What do you want to do ? knock or pick

    Suddenly, you hear a scream from the basement of the manor.
    You find the stairs and descend.


>> IF SEWER
    Making sure nobody saw you, you enter the sewers.
    The place stinks as it should but you see a sewer tunnel that comes from the manor.
    Slowly you make your way to the manor.

    However, a mass that was laid down suddenly rise up, it's {monster}.
    (battle)

    You collect {item} from the corpse.
    {item} gives {item stats} !

    (heal)
    You also drink a potion that looks like a regeneration potion.
    You see a door that connects to the basement of the manor.

You find yourself inside a kind of prison cell with multiple iron doors.
You try to open them one by one but none, except for one, are unlocked.

Feeling near the end, you pass the doorway. 
You're in a gigantic room that is weirdly similar to the arena.

> I knew you would come sooner or later...
> You were not entertaining at all in the arena, some of my friends won't listen to me anymore.
> I was expecting better...
> Die you hobo bastard !!!

A portcullis goes up and {m1 - m4} are running out of the previouly blocked entrance.
(battle)

> How did you survive ? (Nice fight by the way).
> Now I, Icarag the fallen,  have to kill you myself.

You quickly find on the ground and drink a instant health 2 potion.
Icarag the fallen spares you no time, you have to fight.
(battle)

You've defeated anybody who stood on your path...
You will very likely die a hobo.


Why not trying a more unusual difficulty next time ?





>> Text secret difficulty

Your legs surprisingly goes numb and you get knocked out as the side of your head hit the ground.
You're not dead, just transported to an other place.

You're kinda lost, it is like a palace but the place is filled by the scent of perfectly cooked sausages.
You inside the hall, and right before the gigantic door that leads to the throne room, there are 8 slot machines.
A voice comes from the room.

> You better get prepared before fighting against Zahogar the almighty !
> Each slot machine gives you a piece of equipment.

With no other choice, you pull the lever of all the 8 slot machines.
{item} gives {item stats} ! x8

Now fully equiped, the doors open and you are facing Zahogar the almighty.
(battle)

HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW ?!?!?!?!?!
WHAT THE HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLL !!!!!!!!!!!!
Wait, let me process... [UIIA IAU UUIIA]

Ok, it is unexpected I must say.
I think I have no other choice.

Congratulation {name}, you are now the evil silly castle sausage pig's master and also the emperor of sausages.
