# ChatGPT_Cpp_projects

## Quick description

Asked ChatGPT to give me a list of project in C++ to learn how to code in that language.

## Beginner projects

## Intermediate projects

* Library Management System

    Add/edit/delete books, search by title/author, manage borrower info.

    Use classes and file I/O for persistent storage.

* Personal Budget Tracker

    Track expenses and income, generate reports.

    Add CSV export/import using file streams.

* Command-Line Text Editor

    Basic features like opening files, editing lines, saving.

    Practice with character-by-character input and file handling.

* Student Database with Sorting & Searching

    Store students with grades, sort by name, GPA, etc.

    Use STL containers like vector, map, and algorithms.

* Mini Shell

    Implement a basic shell that runs user commands using system() or exec equivalents.

    Learn about fork(), pipe(), and process handling on Linux.

* Simple Chat App (Local)

    Build a text-based chat app using sockets (TCP/UDP).

    Great for learning client-server architecture.


## Advanced projects

* Othello/Reversi Game with AI

    Implement full game logic with a simple AI using minimax or alpha-beta pruning.

    Use SFML or Qt for a GUI version.

* Task Scheduler (like cron)

    Allow users to schedule tasks to run at certain times.

    Multithreading, time parsing, and system-level calls involved.

* Custom File Compression Tool

    Implement your own version of Huffman coding or Run-Length Encoding.

    Dive into data encoding and binary file operations.

* Multithreaded Web Crawler

    Crawl web pages starting from a URL, fetch titles/content.

    Learn about multithreading, networking, and parsing HTML.

* 2D Physics Engine

    Handle object collision, gravity, and motion.

    Great if you're into game dev or simulations.

* In-Memory Key-Value Store

    Like a tiny version of Redis.

    Practice hash tables, memory management, and command parsing.

* Simple Compiler/Interpreter

    Build a small language with a lexer, parser, and interpreter.

    Learn how programming languages are built.

## Tooling & Ecosystem Projects

* Build Your Own Make-like Tool

    Parse a .build file and compile based on file dependencies.

    Learn file timestamps and dependency resolution.

* Dynamic Plugin Loader

    Load .dll or .so files at runtime and call exported functions.

    Useful for modular applications and engines.
